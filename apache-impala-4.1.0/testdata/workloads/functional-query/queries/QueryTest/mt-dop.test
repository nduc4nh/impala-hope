---- QUERY
# IMPALA-10970: Verify that a query plan containing 2 parallel plans
# with the first one having a single unpartitioned fragment is
# correctly classified as not being a coordinator only query. This
# query create a plan with the aforementioned condition and has a
# join build fragment that will be co-located with the root sink
# fragment(IMPALMA-4224). This ensures that the query fails to
# schedule and eventually times out in the queue if incorrectly
# classified as a coordinator only query.
# To ensure the inline left table placed at join probe side, we add
# STRAIGHT_JOIN hint to disable join inversion optimization.
