# IMPALA-11123: IMPALA-5861 add this test to verify that 'RowRead' counter is not double
# counted for zero slot scan. IMPALA-11123 remove incerement of 'RowRead' counter
# in case of optimized count(star) and zero slot scan query. This cause reduction of
# 'RowsRead' value from 1200 to 900 since the other 300 are served through
# zero slot scan. We do not verify 'NumFileMetadataRead' since it does not stay the same
# over different test vector permutation.
